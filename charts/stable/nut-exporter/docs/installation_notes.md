### NUT

Set up NUT in server mode and make sure the TCP port (3493 by default) is accessible (without authentication).

If you want to test that it's working, run `telnet <nut-server> 3493` and then `VER`, `LIST UPS` and `LIST VAR <ups>`.

### Docker

Example `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  nut-exporter:
    # Stable v1
    image: hon95/prometheus-nut-exporter:1
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Oslo
      - HTTP_PATH=/metrics
      # Defaults
      #- RUST_LOG=info
      #- HTTP_PORT=9995
      #- HTTP_PATH=/nut
      #- LOG_REQUESTS_CONSOLE=false
      #- PRINT_METRICS_AND_EXIT=false
    ports:
      - "9995:9995/tcp"
```

### Kubernetes Resource Usage
Example container resources requests and limits.
This was done by scraping one NUT server with two UPSes.
Resource usage was observed across 7 days period.
This can be lowered even more but should be sufficient as a starting point.

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: "10m"
    memory: "16Mi"
  requests:
    cpu: "1m"
    memory: "8Mi"
```
